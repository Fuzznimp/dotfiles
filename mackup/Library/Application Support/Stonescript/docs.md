# Dysan blocking / engaging guide

## Phase 1

Block with a combination of: dual ah hammers, ah shield, or fire talisman, depending whether you're at full hp or want to prioritise evasion. Use fire talisman if at full hp, ah hammer if healing is required. The problem with evasion is no healing, hence dual hammers rather than hammer + shield. Distribute your engages among chilling and gaining shield.

## Phase 2

You MUST have the correct element in one hand at the end of state 32, to avoid debuffs. Use either the correct shield, or just keep attacking with RH. However phase 2 damage is the lowest, esp if you can poison, so it's the best chance to heal. Therefore, don't chill during this phase. If buff protection is up, it's a bit of a bummer due to no poison, but you can still "swap armor for hp" by gaining armor during engages and healing during blocks. Dual ah hammers can only be used if he is in aether, if not then just use one hammer in LH and keep chopping with RH.

## Phase 3

This is the highest damage phase, at 18 per normal hit. However, you can still mitigate lots of damage with engage, poison, evasion and healing.
18 - 4 poison - 5 engage - 2 healing = 7 damage, which is very manageable. If blocking with ah shield, enchant healing and not evasion. Only attempt to evade when you at full hp. If so, consider a poison ap evasion-enchanted shield, preferably stacking this with 30% evasion from skeleton_arm. If you survive the first few basic attacks, you can dodge the swipe stun, and of course dodge the big laser. Aim to finish the fight soon after the big laser.
